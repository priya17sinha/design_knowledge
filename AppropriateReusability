> Complete Code Reusability
- When one want complete code reusuaility, we go for inheritance.
-Releationship defined- is-A
- Checks to be made, before applying inheritance
  -Commonality
  -Family
  -variation
  -Concrete- They are required/ compeletness
- Example- Window, Button, TextBox all have same family, UI-Family, have common code, variation exists and the they all are required, so we create another class UIElements(Base class) and other classes inherit from those.
-Always better to mark Base class as abstract(cannot be instantiated, as doesnot have enough info) and its constructor protected(others cannot access it).
> Object Reusuability
- When there exists has-A relation
