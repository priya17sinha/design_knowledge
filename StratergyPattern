#Stratergy Pattern
-Every time we use Runtime Poly, we use Stratergy Pattern.
-Principles involved- SRP(Separate Responsibility)+ DIP/abstraction(To substitute, build interface)=>we use runtime poly,so as to decide which stratergy to use

>OCP- Open Close Principle
-Class is open for modification, close for extension
- Every time, cannot add a new method, as per the user search criteria
